## What is KFMark?

> KFMARK will allow you to profile and benchmark 3D games running on Android, and show current FPS on a floating window, giving you a direct indication of how smoothly the game is running on your device.
> You can optionally record a gaming session and get a complete history of FPS, CPU Frequency and Battery Drain.
> All of the benchmarking history is stored locally on your phone for you to review.
> KFMARK is compatible with Android 5 and up.
